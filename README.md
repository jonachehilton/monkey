# Monkey

Monkey is an interpreted programming language that I wrote by following the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/). 

Monkey has the following features:
 - C-like syntax
 - Variable bindings
 - Strings, Integers, Booleans
 - Arithmetic expressions
 - A few built-in functions
 - First-class and higher-order functions
 - Closures
 - Array data structure
 - Hash data structure

 At the moment, you can only use the REPL, but I plan to add a driver to read from STDIN or a named file.
